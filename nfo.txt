NOTES:
This intro is best viewed under Alacritty (https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty)
If you use an alternate terminal, a dark background is recommended.
Terminal.app and iTerm2 both have sluggish framerate, and it gets worse at higher font sizes.
Upterm has slightly better framerate but some of the characters display at incorrect widths (despite my best efforts to work around that).
Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal performs quite well, but has a habit of leaving broken artifacts across the screen.
Alacritty has flawless framerate performance but fails to render certain emojis, so the intro was carefully designed around that.
